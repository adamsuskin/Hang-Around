# Hang-Around

## Description

I made this project in my senior year of high school (2013-14). It is an app that connects you to your friends on Facebook in a new way!
You can view a friend's availability (available, busy, away) and simply tap their name to notify them that you want to hang out.

## Need-to-Knows

I did not include the Parse framework and FacebookSDK framework in the repo, but they are used. This repo's purpose is to demonstrate some 
of the work I have done in the past couple years. It was created before I utilized Git and Cocoapods into my development workflow.

## Dependencies

If you would like it to work, you would need to download and add the Parse Framework v1.2.11 and 
the FacebookSDK Framework v3.6.

Thanks!
